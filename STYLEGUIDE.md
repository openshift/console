# OpenShift Console Styleguide

## Directory and File Names

- Use lowercase dash-separated names for all files (to avoid git issues with case-insensitive file systems)
- Exceptions are files which have their own naming conventions (eg Dockerfile, Makefile, README)

## Go

- All go code should be formatted by gofmt
- Import statement pkgs should be separated into 3 groups: stdlib, external dependency, current project.
- TESTS: Should follow the "test tables" convention.

## SCSS/CSS

- All SCSS files are imported from the top-level file: `/frontend/public/style.scss`
- No need to import SCSS files as dependencies of others, top-level file handles this.
- All SCSS files should be prefixed with an underscore, (eg `_my-custom-file.scss`).
- When possible, avoid element selectors. Class selectors are preferred.
- Scope all classes with a recognizable prefix to avoid collisions with any imported CSS (this project uses `co-` by convention).
- Class names should be all lowercase and dash-separated.
- All SCSS variables should be scoped within their component.
- We use [BEM](http://getbem.com) naming conventions.

## TypeScript and JavaScript

- New code should be written in TypeScript, not JavaScript.
- Prefer functional components to class-based components.
- Use [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) with functional components if you need state.
- Prefer [composition to inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html).
- Run the linter and follow all rules defined in .eslintrc
- Never use absolute paths in code. The app should be able to run behind a proxy under an arbitrary path.
- TESTS: Should follow a similar "test tables" convention as used in Go where applicable.

### Additional OpenShift Console Specific Practices

**React Component Patterns**:
- Use `React.FCC` instead of `React.FC` for components (fixes legacy dependency issues)

**Type Safety & Kubernetes Integration**:
- Use specific Kubernetes resource types instead of generic `K8sResourceCommon` when possible
- Avoid excessive use of `any` types
- Avoid type assertions with `as any`
- Use optional chaining for safe property access
- Initialize with proper defaults instead of repeated null checks

**Code Organization**:
- Follow established directory structure patterns
- Use consistent import organization
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

### Analysis Process

1. **File Structure**: Check file naming and organization
2. **Go Code Quality**: Verify gofmt formatting and import grouping
3. **TypeScript Usage**: Verify modern TypeScript patterns
4. **React Patterns**: Assess component structure and hooks usage
5. **SCSS/CSS Patterns**: Check BEM naming, prefixing, and organization
6. **Style Guide Compliance**: Check against official OpenShift Console style guide
7. **Code Quality**: Evaluate maintainability and consistency
8. **OpenShift Specific**: Review Kubernetes integration patterns
