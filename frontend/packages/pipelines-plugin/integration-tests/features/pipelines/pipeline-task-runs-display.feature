Feature: Display task runs page
              As a developer, I would like to navigate from a PipelineRun to the related TaskRuns and their associated pods so that I can debug my pipelines by looking at the volumes, secrets, etc that are made available to the taskruns and pods.

        Background:
            Given user has created or selected namespace "aut-pipelines"
              And user is at pipelines page in developer view
