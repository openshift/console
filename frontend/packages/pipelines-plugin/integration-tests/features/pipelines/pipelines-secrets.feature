              As a user, I want to add or remove secrets details to pipeline

        Background:
            Given user has created or selected namespace "aut-pipelines"
              And user is at pipelines page

        Scenario Outline: Add Secrets: P-08-TC01
            Given user has created pipeline "<pipeline_name>" with git resources
              And user is at pipelines page
             When user selects "Start" option from kebab menu for pipeline "<pipeline_name>"
              And user clicks on Show Credentials link present in Start Pipeline modal
              And user clicks on "Add Secret" link
             Then user is able to see Create Source Secret section
              And user is able to see Secret Name, Access to, Server UrL fields and authentication type fields

        Examples:
                  | pipeline_name |
                  | pipe-secret-0 |
