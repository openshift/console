# OpenShift Console 4.20 Release Notes

## Changes to Console provided CSS

> [!WARNING]
> OpenShift web console does not support non-PatternFly CSS provided by Console in plugins.
> The following information is provided for reference only.

OpenShift web console no longer applies styling to the following CSS classes:

- Removed support for the Bootstrap Grid system (`.row`, `.col-*`, etc.). Use
  [PatternFly Grid](https://www.patternfly.org/layouts/grid) instead.
- Removed `co-external-link` styling. Use PatternFly Buttons with `variant="link"` instead.
- Removed `co-disabled` styling.
