# OpenShift Console 4.18 Release Notes

## Changes to Content Security Policy (CSP)

Console CSP feature is disabled by default. To test your plugins with CSP, enable the
`ConsolePluginContentSecurityPolicy` feature gate on a test cluster. This feature gate
should **not** be enabled on production clusters. Enabling this feature gate allows you
to set `spec.contentSecurityPolicy` in your `ConsolePlugin` resource to extend existing
CSP directives, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsolePlugin
metadata:
  name: cron-tab
spec:
  displayName: 'Cron Tab'
  contentSecurityPolicy:
    - directive: 'ScriptSrc'
      values:
        - 'https://example1.com/'
        - 'https://example2.com/'
```

When enabled, Console CSP operates in report-only mode; CSP violations will be logged in
the browser and CSP violation data will be reported through telemetry service in production
deployments.

In a future release, Console will begin enforcing CSP. Consider testing and preparing your
plugins now to avoid CSP related issues in future.
