# OpenShift Console 4.19 Release Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this release, PatternFly 4.x is no longer supported in Console. Starting with Console
> 4.19, only PatternFly 6.x and 5.x are supported. Support for PatternFly 5.x is deprecated and
> is expected to be removed in a future release.

## Changes to shared modules

- Console no longer provides PatternFly 4.x as shared modules. It now uses PatternFly 6.x and provides
  PatternFly 5.x styles to help existing plugins transition.
- Added `@patternfly/react-topology` shared module. This allows plugins to use PatternFly's topology
  components with consistent React context and styling.
- The `react-router-dom-v5-compat` shared module is deprecated and is expected to be removed in a
  future release. Until a migration path is available, plugins can use this module to access React Router v6 APIs.
- `VirtualizedTable`, `ListPageFilter` and `useListPageFilter` are deprecated and are expected to be removed
  in the future. Use PatternFly's [Data view](https://www.patternfly.org/extensions/data-view/overview)
  provides the recommended alternative. See this [proof of concept](https://github.com/openshift/console/pull/14897)
  for an example.

## Deprecations of shared modules

The following shared modules are now deprecated:

- Console provided React Router v5 shared modules
  - `react-router`
  - `react-router-dom`
- Console provided React Router v6 compatibility module
  - `react-router-dom-v5-compat`

A migration path to a newer version of React Router is expected to be provided in a future release.

## Changes to Content Security Policy (CSP)

In OpenShift 4.19, Content Security Policy (CSP) is enabled by default in report-only mode.

title can use the `DocumentTitle` component from `@openshift-console/dynamic-plugin-sdk`.

## Changes to Console provided CSS

Support for PatternFly 5.x within Console is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

> [!WARNING]
> OpenShift web console does not support non-PatternFly CSS provided by Console in plugins.
> The following information is provided for reference only.

OpenShift web console no longer applies styling to the following CSS classes:

- Removed `@fortawesome/font-awesome`. Plugins should use PatternFly icons from `@patternfly/react-icons` instead.

  own CSS to spin icons if needed.
- Removed `openshift-logos-icon`. Plugins should provide icons if needed.

- Removed styling for generic HTML description list elements (e.g., `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`). Use PatternFly
  components instead.

  instead.
- Removed `co-m-page__body` styling. Use [PatternFly Flex](https://www.patternfly.org/layouts/flex) instead.
- Removed `co-m-pane__body` spacing styling. Use
  [PatternFly PageSection](https://www.patternfly.org/components/page#pagesection) instead.
