Feature: Export of application
              As a user, I have an unmanaged application which I want to export. I'd like to be able to later add that code to git or some shared location so that I can share with others, or import into a new cluster or same cluster but different project, or be able to apply updates to an existing application.

            Given user has installed Gitops primer Operator
              And user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-export-application"
