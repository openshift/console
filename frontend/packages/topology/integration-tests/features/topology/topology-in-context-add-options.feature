              And user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-topology-in-context-add"
              And user has created "knative-demo" workload in "aut-knative-demos" application
              And user is at Topology page

             When user right clicks on empty graph view
              And user hovers on Add to Project
             Then user can see in context options "Samples", "Import from Git", "Container Image", "From Catalog", "Database", "Operator Backed", "Helm Charts", "Event Source", "Channel"


        @regression
        Scenario: Add to Application in Context: T-10-TC02
             When user right clicks on Application Grouping "aut-knative-demos"
              And user hovers on Add to application

             When user right clicks on Application Grouping "aut-knative-demos"
              And user clicks on Delete application
              And user enters the name "aut-knative-demos" in the Delete application modal and clicks on Delete button
