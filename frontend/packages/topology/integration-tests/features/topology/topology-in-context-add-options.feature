Feature: Add in context from the Developer Catalog
              As a user, I want to add things in the context in topology


        Background:
            Given user has installed OpenShift Serverless Operator
              And user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-topology-in-context-add"
              And user has created "knative-demo" workload in "aut-knative-demos" application
              And user is at Topology page

        Scenario: Add to Project in Context options: T-10-TC01
             When user right clicks on graph
              And user clicks on Add to Project
             Then user can see in context options Samples, Import from Git, Container Image, From Catalog, Database, Operator Backed, Helm Chart, Event Source, Channel


        @regression @to-do
        Scenario: Add to Application in Context: T-10-TC02
             When user right clicks on Application Grouping "aut-knative-demos"
              And user clicks on Add to Application
             Then user can see in context options Import from Git, Container Image, Event Source, Channel


        @regression @to-do
        Scenario: Delete Application from the Context options: T-10-TC03
             When user right clicks on Application Grouping "aut-knative-demos"
              And user clicks on Delete Application
             Then user won't be able to see the "aut-knative-demos" Application Groupings
