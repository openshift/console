        Scenario Outline: Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler to deployment workload: TH-02-TC01
            Given user has created a deployment workload "nodejs-ex-git" with CPU resource limit "100" and Memory resource limit "100"
              And user is at Topology page
             When user clicks on workload "nodejs-ex-git"
              And user selects "Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler" option from Actions menu
              And user enters Name as "<hpa_name>" in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler page
              And user sets Minimum Pods value to "<hpa_min_pod>"
              And user sets Maximum Pods value to "<hpa_max_pod>"
              And user enters CPU Utilization as "<cpu_utilisation>"

              And user clicks on workload "nodejs-ex-git"
              And user selects Resources tab on sidebar
             Then user can see two pods under pod section
              And user can see HorizontalPodAutoscalers section
              And user can see the "<hpa_name>" with HPA tag associated present under HPA section

        Examples:
                  | hpa_name | hpa_min_pod | hpa_max_pod | cpu_utilisation | memory_utilization |
                  | test-hpa | 2           | 5           | 60              | 30                 |

              And user goes to the details tab
             Then user can see the changed pods number

        Examples:
                  | workload_name   | hpa_max_pod | hpa_min_pod | cpu_utilisation | memory_utilization |

             When user right clicks on workload "nodejs-ex-git-1"
              And user selects "Remove HorizontalPodAutoscaler" option from context menu
              And user clicks Remove on "Remove HorizontalPodAutoscaler?" modal
              And user clicks on workload "nodejs-ex-git-1"
