              And user sees "Pod Count" and "Labels" under "Show" and "Expand" have options according to their presence which are "Application Groupings" and "knative Services"
              And user deselects "Labels" which is selected by default

              And user hovers over application grouping the label appears
              And user selects "Pod Count" which is deselected by default
