              As a user, I want to connect two application

        Background:
            Given user is at developer perspective
              And user is at Add page
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-tp-connect-workloads"
              And user has created workload "nodejs-ex-git" with resource type "Deployment"
              And user is at Add page
