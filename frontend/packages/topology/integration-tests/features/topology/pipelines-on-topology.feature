Feature: Improve the integration of Pipelines & Builds.
              As a user, I want to see pipelines instead of build

        Background:
            Given user has installed OpenShift Pipelines operator using cli
              And user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-topology"


        @regression @to-do
        Scenario Outline: Import flows should create pipeline instead of build config: T-01-TC01
            Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline
              And pipeline has autostarted
             When user clicks on workload "<workload_name>"
             Then user can see Pipeline Runs section
              And user can not see Buildconfig Runs section

        Examples:
                  | resource_type     | workload_name   |
                  | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
                  | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


        @regression @to-do
        Scenario Outline: Add flow should finish even if the Pipeline Run cannot be created for the added Pipeline: T-01-TC02
            Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" and builder image "<builder_image>" with pipeline
              And pipeline has not autostarted
             When user clicks on workload "<workload_name>"
             Then user can see an alert "Pipeline could not be started automatically" in the Pipeline Runs section of the sidebar
              And user is able to see Start button to start a pipeline run

        Examples:
                  | resource_type     | workload_name             | builder_image |
                  | deployment        | s-2-i-dotnetcore-ex-git-1 | .Net core     |
                  | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1           | Perl          |

        Scenario Outline: Pipeline start modal on clicking pipeline icon of application node in topology page: T-01-TC03
            Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline
             When user hovers on the bottom-left decorator on the workload "<workload_name>"
              And user clicks on the pipeline with not started text
             Then user can see Pipeline start modal

        Examples:
                  | resource_type     | workload_name   |
                  | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
                  | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |

             When user goes to the pipeline
             Then user can see the "<workload_name>" pipeline is succeeded

        Examples:
                  | resource_type     | workload_name   |
                  | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
