        Scenario Outline: Editing a workload: T-09-TC01
            Given user has created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>"
             When user right clicks on the workload "<workload_name>" to open the Context Menu
              And user clicks on "Edit <workload_name>" from context action menu
              And user edits application groupings to "<application_groupings>"
              And user saves the changes
             Then user can see application groupings updated to "<application_groupings>"
