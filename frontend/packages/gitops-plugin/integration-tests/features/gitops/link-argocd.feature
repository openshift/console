Feature: External Argo CD Link for Argo CD Dashboard
              As a developer, I want a way to navigate to Argo CD from the Deploy Stages page of the OpenShift console so that I can get insight on the sync status of my application.


        Background:
            Given user has installed gitOps operator
              And user is at administrator perspective

    
        @regression @manual
        Scenario: External link to the ArgoCD Dashboard: GO-02-TC01
            Given user has logged in to cluster using CLI
              And user has created namespace "test-argocd"
              And user has imported a gitops repo using kam command to namespace "test-aregocd"
             Then user will see external link to the ArgoCD dashboard in Application Launcher
              And user will see external link to the ArgoCD dashboard on Environments page on DevConsole
              And user will see external link to the ArgoCD dashboard on each Environment on Environments page on DevConsole
