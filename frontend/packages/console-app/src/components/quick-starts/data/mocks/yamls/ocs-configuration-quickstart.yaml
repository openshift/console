  description: Learn how to configure OpenShift Container Storage to meet your deployment
    needs.
  prerequisites: ["Getting Started with Openshift Container Storage"]
  introduction: In this tour you will learn about the various configurations available
    to customize your OpenShift Container Storage deployment.
  tasks:
  - title: Expand the OCS Storage Cluster
    description: |- 
      When we install the OCS operator we created a storage cluster, chose
      the cluster size, provisioned the underlying storage subsystem, deployed necessary
      drivers, and created the storage classes to allow the Openshift users to easily
      provision and consume storage services that have just been deployed
      
      When the capacity of the cluster is about to run out we will notify you.

      **To expand the OCS storage cluster follow these steps:**
      
      1. Go to installed operators page and click on **Openshift Container Storage** 
      2. Go to storage cluster tab
      3. Click on the **3 dots icon** 
      4. Click on add capacity
      5. Use the expand cluster modal if your capacity is about to runout.
    review:
      instructions: |-
        ####  Verify that you have expanded your storage cluster. 

        Does the status of the StorageCluster show as Ready?
      failedTaskHelp: This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
    summary:
      success: You have expanded the Openshift Container Storage operator!
      failed: Try the steps again.
  - title: Backing store & Bucket class
    description: |-
      **Backing Store**
      Backing store is representing a storage target to be used as the underlying storage for the data in MCG buckets. These storage targets are used to store deduped+compressed+encrypted chunks of data (encryption keys are stored separately).

      **To create a new Backing store:**

      1. Go to installed operators page and click one Openshift Container Storage.
      2. Go to backing store tab.
      3. Click on **Create Backing Store**
      4. Fill all required fields to finish creation process.

      **Bucket class**

      Bucket class policy determine the bucket's data location.
      Data placement capabilities area built as a multi-tier structure, here are the Tiers bottom-up-

      **Spread Tier** - list of backing-stores, aggregates the storage of multiple stores.

      **Mirroring Tier** - list of spread-Tiers, async-mirroring to all mirros, with locality optimization.

      **Create a new Bucket class:**
      1. Go to installed operators page and click one Openshift Container Storage,
      2. Go to bucket class tab.
      3. Click on **Create Bucket Class**
      4. Follow the wizard steps to  finish creation process.

      instructions: |-
        ####  Verify that you have created bucket class and backing store. 

        Does the status of the Backing Store and Bucket Class show as Ready?
      failedTaskHelp: This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
    summary:
      success: You have successfully created backing store and bucket class
      failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: Congrats, the Openshift Container Storage operator is ready to use.
