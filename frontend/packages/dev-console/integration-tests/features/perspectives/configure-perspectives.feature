Feature: Configure perspectives
              As a administrator, I want to configure the perspectives which are being shown in the Perspectives dropdown in the console, this includes enabling, disabling or adding access review checks to available perspective(s).


        Background:
            Given user has logged in as admin user

            Given user is at cluster YAML of "operator.openshift.io/v1" console
             When user adds the "Add user perspectives" code snippet under spec.customization.perspectives
              And user changes the visibility state of "admin" to "Disabled" and removes the remaining perspectives
              And user clicks on Save button
              And user clicks on Perspective dropdown
             Then user will not see "Administrator" perspective in the Perspective switcher
