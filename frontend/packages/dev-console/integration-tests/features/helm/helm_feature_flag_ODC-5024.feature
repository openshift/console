Feature: Feature flag for Helm
    As a user, I want to disable helm specific navigation items from console if there are no helm repositories configured in the console.


    Background:
        Given user is at developer perspective
        And user has selected namespace "aut-helm-feature-flag"


    @regression, @manual
    Scenario: Disable helm features in console
        Given user is at Helm Chart Repositories page
        And user can see only the default "redhat-helm-repo" CR is available
        When user opens "redhat-helm-repo" CR
        And user goes to YAML tab
        And user adds "disabled: true" flag under "spec"
        And user clicks on Save
        Then user is not able to see the Helm tab in the navigation menu
        And user can not see Helm Chart card in Add page
        And user can not see Helm Charts filter in the Developer Catalog page
