    Scenario: Pipeline Builder page : P-03-TC02
        Given user is at pipelines page
        When user clicks Create Pipeline button on Pipelines page
        Then user will be redirected to Pipeline Builder page
        And user is able to see pipeline name with default value "new-pipeline"
        And Tasks, Paramters and Resources sections are displayed
        # And Edit Yaml link is enabled - Edit Yaml button is removed, so now we are verifying Yaml view radio button
        And Yaml view configuration is displayed
