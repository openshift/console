Feature: Event Sources actions
   As a user, I want to perform actions on event sources

   Background:
      Given user has installed OpenShift Serverless Operator
      And user is at developer perspective
      And user is at Add page
      And user has selected namespace "aut-create-knative-event-source"


   @regression
   Scenario: Event source context menu options : Kn-11-TC01
      Given user has created knative service "nodejs-ex-git"
      And user has created "sink-binding" event source
      When user right clicks on the event source "sink-binding" to open context menu
      Then user is able to see context menu
      And user can see options Edit Application Groupings, Move Sink, Edit Labels, Edit Annotations, Edit SinkBinding, Delete SinkBinding


   @smoke
   Scenario: Move sink to different knative service using context menu: Kn-11-TC02
      Given user has created knative services "nodejs-ex-git" and "nodejs-ex-git-1"
      And user has created "sink-binding" event source
      And knative service, event source and sink connector are present in topology page
      When user right clicks on the event source "sink-binding" to open context menu
      And user selects "Move Sink" from context menu
      And user selects the knative service "nodejs-ex-git-1" from Resource dropdown
      And user clicks on save
      Then user will see that event source "sink-binding" is sinked with knative Service "nodejs-ex-git-1"


   @smoke
   Scenario: Delete event source : Kn-11-TC06
      Given knative service named "nodejs-ex-git" is higlighted on topology page
      And event source "sink-binding" is higlighted on topology page
      And knative service, event source and sink connector are present in topology page
      When user right clicks on the event source "sink-binding" to open context menu
      And user selects "Delete SinkBinding" from context menu
      And user selects the Delete option on "Delete SinkBinding?" modal
      Then event source "sink-binding" will not be displayed in topology page
