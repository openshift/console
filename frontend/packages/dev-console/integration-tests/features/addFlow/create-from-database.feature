    Scenario: Create the Database from Add page : A-10-TC01
        Given user is at Add page
        When user clicks Database card
        And user selects "MariaDB" database on Developer Catalog
        And user clicks Instantiate Template button on side bar
        And user clicks create button on Instantiate Template page with default values
        Then user will be redirected to Topology page
        And user is able to see workload "mariadb" in topology page
