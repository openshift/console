Feature: Create Application from Docker file
   As a user, I want to create the application, component or service from Add Flow Docker file

   Background:
      Given user is at developer perspective
      And user has created namespace starts with "aut-addflow-docker"
      And user is at Add page


   @regression
   Scenario: Dockerfile details after entering git repo url: A-06-TC01
      Given user is on Import from Docker file page
      When user enters docker git url as "https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git"
      Then git url gets Validated
      And application name displays as "nodejs-ex-git-app"
      And name field auto populates with value "nodejs-ex-git" in Import from Docker file page


   @smoke
   Scenario Outline: Create a workload from Docker file with "<resource_type>" as resource type : A-06-TC03, A-06-TC04
      Given user is on Import from Docker file page
      When user enters docker git url as "https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git"
      And user enters Name as "<name>"
      And user selects "<resource_type>" radio button in Resoruce type section
      And user clicks Create button on Add page
      Then user will be redirected to Topology page
      And user is able to see workload "<name>" in topology page

      Examples:
         | resource_type     | name            |
         | Deployment        | nodejs-ex-git   |
         | Deployment Config | nodejs-ex-1-git |
