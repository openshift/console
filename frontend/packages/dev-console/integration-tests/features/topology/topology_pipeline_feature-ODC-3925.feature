Feature: Improve the integration of Pipelines & Builds.
	As a user, I want to see pipelines instead of build

Background:
    Given user is at developer perspective
    And user has installed Openshift Pipelines Operator
    And user has selected namespace "aut-topology-pipeline"


@regression
Scenario Outline: Import flows should create pipeline instead of build config
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline 
   And pipeline has autoStarted
   When user clicks on workload "<workload_name>"
   Then user can see Pipeline Runs section
   And user can not see Buildconfig Runs section   

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Add flow should finish even if the Pipeline Run cannot be created for the added Pipeline
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" and builder image "<builder_image>" with pipeline 
   And pipeline has not autoStarted
   When user clicks on workload "<workload_name>"
   Then user can see an alert "Pipeline could not be started automatically" in the Pipeline Runs section of the sidebar  
   And user is able to see Start button to start a pipeline run

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name             | builder_image |
    | deployment        | s-2-i-dotnetcore-ex-git-1 | .Net core     |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1           | Perl          |


@regression, @manual
Scenario Outline: Pipeline start modal on clicking pipeline icon of application node in topology page
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline 
   When user hovers on the bottom-left decorator on the workload "<workload_name>"
   And user clicks on the pipeline with not started text
   Then user can see Pipeline start modal

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Pipelines are getting executed successfully
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline
   When user goes to the pipeline
   Then user can see the "<workload_name>" pipeline is succeeded 

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: PVC getting created through the add flow pipeline auto start feature
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline
   When user goes to the Administrator perspective
   And user clicks on the Persistent Volume Claims in Storage tab
   Then user can see workspace created for for the resource

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: PVC getting auto selected using the pipeline label attached to it
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline
   When user goes to the pipeline
   And user clicks on Start on the "<workload_name>" pipeline
   Then user can see "PVC" in workspace with name of PVC

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: In Add trigger, PVC getting auto selected
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline
   When user goes to the pipeline
   And user clicks on Add Trigger on the "<workload_name>" pipeline
   Then user can see "PVC" in workspace with name of PVC

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Pipeline section in edit flow when pipeline is already present
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" with pipeline 
   When user clicks on Edit "<workload_name>" from action menu
   Then user can see Pipeline checkbox is disabled
   And user can not see Build configuration option in Advanced Options

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Pipeline section in edit flow when pipeline is not present
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" without pipeline 
   When user clicks on Edit "<workload_name>" from action menu
   Then user can see Pipeline section is present
   And user can see Pipeline checkbox is present in enabled state

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Pipeline is enabled through edit flow
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" without pipeline 
   When user clicks on Edit "<workload_name>" from action menu
   And user checks the Pipeline checkbox to disable build configuration in Advanced Options
   And user clicks on Save
   And user opens sidebar of workload " <workload_name>"
   Then user can see Pipeline section is present
   And user can see Build config section is present

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 |
    | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Pipeline section when builder image is changed to one having pipeline associated
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" and builder image "<builder_image1>" with pipeline 
   When user clicks on Edit "<workload_name>" from action menu
   And user edit the application with  "<builder_image2>" 
   Then user will see the message "Pipeline will be updated to match the builder image" with pipeline option selected

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   | builder_image1 | builder_image2 |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 | Node.js        | Python         |
    | deployment config | django-ex.git-1 | Python         | Perl           |


@regression
Scenario Outline: Pipeline section when builder image is changed to one not having pipeline associated
   Given user created workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "<resource_type>" and builder image "<builder_image1>" with pipeline 
   When user clicks on Edit "<workload_name>" from action menu
   And user edit the application with  "<builder_image2>" 
   Then user will see the message "There are no pipeline templates available for "<builder_image2>", current pipeline will be dissociated from the application"

Examples:
    | resource_type     | workload_name   | builder_image1 | builder_image2 |
    | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git-1 | Node.js        | Nginx          |
    | deployment config | django-ex.git-1 | Python         | Httpd          |
