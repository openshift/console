Feature: Application groupings in topology
	As a user, I want to check application groupings  

Background:
    Given user is at developer perspective
    And user has selected namespace "aut-topology-grouping"
   #  And user is at the Topolgy page
    

@regression, @smoke
Scenario: Verify Application grouping sidebar: T-04-TC08
   Given user has created workload "nodejs-ex-git"
   When user clicks on an applicaton grouping "nodejs-ex-git-app"
   Then user can see application sidebar
   And user is able to see workload "nodejs-ex-git" under resources tab in the sidebar
   And user can see Add to Application and Delete Application in the Action menu


@regression, @smoke
Scenario: Verify Application grouping context menu : T-06-TC04
   Given user has created workload "nodejs-ex-git"
   When user right clicks on Application "nodejs-ex-git-app" to open context menu
   Then user can view Add to Application and Delete Application options
