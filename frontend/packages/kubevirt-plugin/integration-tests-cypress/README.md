###Available env variables

- `STORAGE_CLASS` - specify if you want to use other sc than the default one
- `UPLOAD_IMG` - specify path to image to be uploaded, defaults to `/tmp/cirros.img`
- `DOWNSTREAM` - specify if tests are running against downstream, or upstream. Defaults to false
- `DUALSTACK` - specify if tests can be run in a dual stack network cluster. Use for IPv6-related tests

## Tests subjects
- You should organize tests by pages and by components as you should test components individually if possible. *.includes files are ignored by cypress. You can nest describe functions of includes files inside a main spec file of the same component/page. The folder structure for tests might look like. 

├ component
├── test-a.includes.ts
├── test-b.includes.ts
├── component.spec.ts
├ page
├── test-a.includes.ts
├── test-b.includes.ts
├── page.spec.ts
