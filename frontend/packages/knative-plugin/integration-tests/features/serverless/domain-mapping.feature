Feature: Custom Domain Mapping Support
              As a user, I would like to have the ability to provide a custom domain for the routes configured for serverless applications.


        Background:
            Given user has installed OpenShift Serverless Operator
              And user has created Knative Eventing CR
              And user has created Knative Serving CR
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-eventing-domain"


        @smoke @to-do
        Scenario Outline: Create knative workload from From Git card and add domain mapping to knative service: KN-07-TC01
            Given user is at Import from git page
             When user enters Git Repo url as "<git_url>"
              And user enters Name as "<workload_name>"
              And user selects resource type as "Serverless Deployment"
              And user clicks on Show advanced Routing options
              And user creates new custom domain mapping "<custom_domain>"
              And user clicks on "Create <custom_domain>"
              And user clicks Create button
             Then user will be redirected to Topology page
              And user is able to see workload "<workload_name>" in topology page
              And user will see "<custom_domain>" under Domain Mappings of Resources tab on sidebar

        Examples:
                  | git_url                                 | workload_name | custom_domain |
                  | https://github.com/sclorg/golang-ex.git | knative-git   | domain.kn     |
