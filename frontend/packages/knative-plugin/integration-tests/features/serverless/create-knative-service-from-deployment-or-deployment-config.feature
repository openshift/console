Feature: Create Knative service from existing Deployment/Deployment Config workloads
              As a user, I should be able to create a serverless app(knative service) from existing deployment/deployment-config and specify any advanced options which I'm able to specify upon creating a knative service

        Background:
            Given user has created or selected namespace "1aut-deployment-knative"


        @regression
        Scenario: Create serverless workload (ksvc) for existing Deployment from Action menu: KN-04-TC01
            Given user is at Add page
              And user has created a deployment workload "dep-workload"
              And workload "dep-worload" is present in topology page
              And user clicks on "dep-workload" to verify that build is completed
             When user clicks on "dep-workload" to open sidebar
              And user selects option "Make Serverless" from Actions menu drop down
              And user enters the Name as "sev-workload" in Make Serverless form
