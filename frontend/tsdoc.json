  // Note: we don't care about declaring these via "supportForTags" field since
  // - 1) there is no inherent value in "this TSDoc tag is not supported by this tool" warnings,
  // - 2) the current TSDoc parser implementation has a bug where declaring custom TSDoc tag(s)
  // results in all the standard tags such as "@param" or "@returns" to be marked as unsupported,
  // so we'd have to list them all explicitly via "supportForTags" field.
