# This file is an example of how you might set up your environment to
# run the tectonic console against OpenShift during development. To use it for running
# bridge, do
#
# . contrib/oc-environment.sh
# ./bin/bridge
#

# You'll need a working oc logged in, and you'll need jq installed and in your
# path for this script to work correctly.

# The environment variables beginning with "BRIDGE_" act just like
# bridge command line arguments - in fact. to get more information
# about any of them, you can run ./bin/bridge --help
